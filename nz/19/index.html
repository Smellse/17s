  <p class="info">The picturesque seaside town of Picton is the South Island base for the ferry service that links the main islands of New Zealand. It’s also the gateway to the marine, forest and island attractions of the Marlborough Sounds. Built around a very sheltered harbour, the town has an attractive seafront dotted with cafés, restaurants and various types of galleries. There’s also a floating maritime museum and an aquarium. Local operators can take you cruising, fishing, dolphin watching or sea kayaking. The Queen Charlotte Track is a major local attraction; you can conquer it on foot or on a mountain bike. Functional facts: Approx. population 3000, i-SITE Visitor Centre, ferry services to and from the North Island.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
